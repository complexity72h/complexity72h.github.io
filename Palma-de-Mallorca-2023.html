                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">ABSTRACT</span>
                  <br>Classical cyber defense mechanisms are not well suited for some of the threats that we can find nowadays. For instance, IoT devices tend to be poorly secured, making them the perfect target for malware and the creation of large-scale botnets. There have been recent proposals to leverage the weaknesses of IoT devices by using white worms to gain control of them and fix their vulnerabilities. However, besides the ethical concerns that this activity may raise, is it a viable strategy? Under which conditions? These questions will be addressed using models of epidemic-spreading processes with competing pathogens both from a theoretical and a numerical point of view.<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">ABSTRACT</span>&nbsp;<br>Innovation is an essential process in cities, which is nevertheless, very difficult to capture or to measure. There is no simple or universal answer to the questions of 1) what is an innovation, and 2) what are the mechanisms that gave rise to it. Insights to these questions are essential to create the right conditions for the drivers to emerge. The most common proxy for innovation, mainly related to the domain of science and technology, is a patent. Although this can be considered as a poor proxy for many different reasons that we will discuss, it captures to some extent a process of intervening fields or domains that gave rise to the patented innovation. The reference system when patenting is responsible for this: patents need to make reference to other patents that are thought to be essential contributors to the conception of this innovation. In this workshop we will analyse patent data from 1977 to 2019, and identify the influence of industries on each other for the patenting process in the UK. We will look at whether proximity and similarity of industries play an important role in the spillover of knowledge, and whether this has changed over time.<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">ABSTRACT</span>
                  <br>Many human activities follow temporal patterns that have several interesting characteristics. On the one hand&nbsp;there are temporal regularities that arise (yearly, monthly, weekly, daily). On the other hand many activities&nbsp;occur in bursts, having long periods of inactivity followed by clusters of many events. When talking about<br>communication activities all these characteristics are observable, but also the appearance of communication&nbsp;networks. How do the communication networks form and evolve in time taking into account burstiness,&nbsp;periodic patterns and mesoscopic characteristics of the network such as cascades and formation of<br>communities will be the central topic for the project. It will consist of two parts, the first centered on the&nbsp;analysis of communication data; and the second one on the modeling of the observed patterns.<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">ABSTRACT</span>
                  <br>The goal of this project is to study the relationship between content engagement and&nbsp;echo chambers on Twitter. Echo chambers have been shown to contribute to the&nbsp;polarization of online environments, and platform algorithms may exacerbate this issue by&nbsp;limiting users' exposure to differing opinions and increasing segregation. While previous&nbsp;research on echo chambers on Twitter has focused on users' interactions, this project&nbsp;aims to go further by also considering the overall attention generated by a piece of<br>content and how it relates to the echo chamber it belongs to. This project aims to utilize&nbsp;the "view count" feature on Twitter to compare the number of active users within echo&nbsp;chambers to the outreach of the content. This will allow for an investigation into whether&nbsp;there is any algorithmic bias in favor of one side of the debate. By comparing the number&nbsp;of users actively engaging with content within echo chambers and the overall reach of<br>that content, this project aims to gain a better understanding of the dynamics at play&nbsp;within these online communities and how they are influenced by platform algorithms.&nbsp;Additionally, this study will compare the results obtained through this method to those<br>obtained by state-of-the-art models simulating online dynamics, in order to estimate the&nbsp;number of users who view content but do not interact with it. To conduct this research,&nbsp;Twitter data on a heated topic (e.g. politics, vaccines) and information on source reliability<br>(e.g. classifications from allsides.com, MediaBiasFactCheck.com) will be needed.<br>

                  <br>Evolutionary dynamics and cooperation in hybrid human-AI populations&nbsp;<br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">ABSTRACT</span>
                  <br>Cooperation, in which agents seek ways to jointly improve their welfare, is ubiquitous in human societies. Arguably, the success of the human species is rooted in our ability to cooperate. Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) has been used to mathematically study the mechanisms which lead to the emergence and evolution of cooperative behaviours in human societies with diverse behavioural strategies in co-presence. Their systematic study also resorts to agent-based modelling and simulation techniques, thus enabling the exploration of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions and application domains.<br>However, similar issues in the context of hybrid mixed populations of humans and artificial intelligence (AI) agents have begun to amass attention only very recently. Since machines powered by artificial intelligence or AI agents are playing an increasingly more important role in our lives, it will be important to equip them with the capabilities necessary to cooperate and to foster cooperation. This project will design EGT models to study the emergence and stability of cooperation behaviours in hybrid human-AI populations where human and AI agents exist in co-presence, interact with each other, and evolve over time. This project will explore new factors that might arise in this hybrid setting (e.g. how AI agents learn socially or individually, process information and update behaviours differently from humans) and design EGT models to explore how they might influence the population dynamics and cooperative outcomes.<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">ABSTRACT</span>
                  <br>In the last decades, behavioral data, mostly from geolocated mobile phone records, has enabled researchers to quantitatively study individual and collective human behaviors to capture and reproduce regularities in&nbsp;spatio-temporal mobility and social structures and any local anomalies. Such high-resolution data have been<br>used to predict how infectious diseases spread, to characterize social segregation, or to respond to extreme&nbsp;events such as earthquakes, wildfires, and hurricanes.&nbsp;Over the past 20 months, however, our world has become arrested by the surges caused by SARS-CoV-2,&nbsp;the virus causing COVID-19. With each surge, there are disruptions to routine life through school closures,&nbsp;reductions in leisure activities, and adaptive human behavior (e.g., self-isolation, avoidance of indoor activities,&nbsp;and preferences to keep outdoor venues for gatherings like conferences, sports, and religious<br>events) [3,4]. COVID-19 surges and the interconnected behavioral aspects alter the recurrent habits of&nbsp;humans. Additionally, environmental and climate changes have a key role in changing daily indoor and outdoor&nbsp;human activities. The combination of these factors makes human behavior extremely difficult to predict.<br>To help fight the pandemic, however, network operators such as Orange, Vodafone, and Telefonica and&nbsp;companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Cuebiq, SafeGraph, and Unacast made a huge effort to quickly share&nbsp;their aggregated behavioral data in real-time at large scale and fine resolution. Many challenges have arisen as<br>a result of this unprecedented data sharing phenomenon. Novel methodological frameworks to pool such&nbsp;empirical data for crisis management are needed.&nbsp;This project will use fine-scale behavioral data from SafeGraph to characterize short- and long-term changes in&nbsp;human activity in a pandemic scenario. Using time series and clustering analysis, we will quantify activity in&nbsp;indoor versus outdoor environments in the United States at 5 million locations nationwide from 2019 to 2022.&nbsp;Developing a SEIR compartmental model for respiratory COVID-like diseases, we will also provide a&nbsp;parameterization of real-time behavior that can be included in infectious disease dynamics models to better&nbsp;predict epidemic activity.<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: 700;">ABSTRACT</span>&nbsp;<br>Transport, dispersion and mixing of water masses play a fundamental role in several physical and biological processes happening within the oceanic environment. Due to the intrinsic temporal variability of ocean currents, fluid transport patterns can present a marked time dependence across a wide range of scales, from days to years. We propose to assess such temporal features of the ocean using a network approach in which different locations of the ocean are associated with the network nodes while links weights are proportional to the amount of fluid exchanged between node pairs. We focus on sets of snapshot networks (already available) representing oceanic transport across different time windows. Network theory methods will be then used to define and characterize the proprieties of the temporal networks derived from such sets of snapshots. Finally, related aspects of marine ecology, such as gene flow and metapopulation dynamics, will be discussed and possibly investigated.

                  <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-7"> Otree is a Python package developed mainly for research on human behaviour, but can be also useful for teaching purposes. With this package, we can create experiments that require participants to make decisions, and it can automatically collect the data and make changes depending on the participants' choices. Additionally, Otree uses HTML pages to run experiments, so we can use the JavaScript library Cytoscape to visualize graphs, which is a crucial aspect of complex systems. Even without Otree, Cytoscape can be used to plot graphs for other purposes. In this tutorial, I plan to show the basic features of these two tools by giving instructions on how to program a simple voter model on a network or explaining an already done code of that experiment, depending on the time given.</p>

                  <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-10"> Complex systems often exhibit unpredictable and non-linear behavior, challenging traditional modeling techniques. Decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) presents a valuable framework to address these limitations, offering researchers a more robust approach to complexity modeling. By adopting deep uncertainty principles and embedding models in a multi-objective optimization setup, researchers can uncover vulnerable scenarios, identify optimal policy solutions for multiple objectives, and ensure robustness across a wide range of scenarios. This presentation will emphasize the advantages of integrating DMDU into complexity models, including enhanced adaptability, robustness, and improved scenario analysis. We will discuss the key principles of this approach and demonstrate its practical benefits, such as robust policy design and effective management of unforeseen risks. By embracing DMDU, researchers can unlock new levels of insight, driving more informed and resilient decision-making in complex systems.</p>
